Automated Scripts Cron Jobs Embed Codex CLI commands in shell scripts for routine tasks (e.g., updating docs, lint fixes) and schedule via cron or task runners. Collaborate with Your Code Ask for explanations: codex \"Explain the purpose of src utils.js\" Generate edits: codex --approval-mode suggest \"Refactor the authentication logic into a separate module\" Apply fixes automatically: codex --approval-mode auto-edit \"Fix lint errors in src \" Keep one terminal for coding, testing, and git commands; use the other exclusively for Codex prompts. If Codex suggests edits, youll see a diff in the REPLapprove or reject each change. You can also run oneoff prompts without entering the REPL: codex \"Add JSDoc comments to all functions in lib \" GitHub Discussions Issues: [URL]"}]}

Disable with --no-project-doc. Config file at .codex config.yaml, for defaults like: fullAutoErrorMode: ask-user Docker Container Spin up a lightweight container: docker run --rm -it node:20 bash npm install -g openai codex export OPENAI_API_KEY \"...\" Keeps your host system clean and reproducible. 3. Integrated Development Environments VS Code: open the integrated terminal and invoke codex. JetBrains IDEs: use the builtin terminal. Any editor with a terminal pane (e.g., Sublime Text, Emacs, Vim tmux splits). 4. CloudHosted Terminals GitHub Codespaces or Gitpod: preconfigured dev environmentsjust add Codex to your dotfiles or install at project startup. Cloud Shells: Google Cloud Shell, AWS CloudShell, or Azure Cloud Shell all support npm and can run Codex CLI directly. 5. Remote Servers SSH SSH into a Linux VM or baremetal server, install Node.js Codex, and run just as you would locally. Useful for heavier compute or shared team environments. 6. Continuous Integration CI Pipelines GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, etc. Run headlessly with flags like --approval-mode auto-edit --quiet to apply edits or generate artifacts in your build workflow. 7. Automated Scripts Cron Jobs Embed Codex CLI commands in shell scripts for routine tasks (e.g., updating docs, lint fixes) and schedule via cron or task runners."}]}
