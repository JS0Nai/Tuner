This design choice offers: Advantages: Easier distribution as a single file, no need to manage separate template directories Disadvantages: Less maintainable for larger applications with multiple pages For a more maintainable approach, you could: Move the HTML template to a separate file in a templates directory Use Flask's template rendering system properly Add static assets (CSS, JS) in a separate static directory Integration with Other Components The web interface integrates with the other scripts by: Running fine_tuning_pipeline.py as a subprocess Reading pipeline results from the filesystem Presenting them in the UI This approach works well for a standalone tool but doesn't provide deep integration with the pipeline components. The web_interface.py file is mostly sound but has the issues mentioned above. It's designed as a single, self-contained file that embeds the HTML template. For production use, I recommend: Fixing the download function as suggested Updating the deprecated parameter Considering moving the template to a separate file if you plan to extend the interface Adding more robust error handling, especially for larger datasets Would you like me to provide a fully corrected version of the web interface file?RetryJLyes pleaseEdit[Timestamp: 2025-04-15 13:30:47 UTC] Here's the fully corrected version of the web interface file:web_interface.pyCode ! usr bin env python3 Web Interface for LLM Fine-tuning Pipeline A simple web interface to manage the fine-tuning preparation process."}]}
