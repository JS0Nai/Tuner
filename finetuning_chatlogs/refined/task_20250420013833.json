Here's my assessment: The file includes: A complete Flask application HTML template content (embedded in the Python file) Route handlers for controlling the pipeline Background thread management for running processes Potential Issues I identified a couple of issues that need to be fixed: Download Route Issue: The download_directory function has a problem. It creates a zip file in memory but then tries to use send_from_directory which won't work with the in-memory file. Here's the fix: def download_directory(directory): \"\"\"Download a directory as a ZIP file.\"\"\" from io import BytesIO from flask import send_file final_dir BASE_DIR \"final\" dir_path final_dir directory if not dir_path.exists() or not dir_path.is_dir(): return \"Directory not found\", 404 Create a ZIP file in memory memory_file BytesIO() with zipfile.ZipFile(memory_file, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf: for root, _, files in os.walk(dir_path): for file in files: file_path os.path.join(root, file) arcname os.path.relpath(file_path, final_dir) zipf.write(file_path, arcname) memory_file.seek(0) return send_file( mimetype 'application zip', as_attachment True, attachment_filename f\"{directory}_dataset.zip\" except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Error creating download: {e}\") return \"Error creating download\", 500 Deprecated Parameter: The attachment_filename parameter is deprecated in newer Flask versions.
