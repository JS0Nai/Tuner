This system processes your content through several stages to create high-quality datasets suitable for various LLM fine-tuning frameworks.\nSystem Components\n1. Content Extraction (content_extractor.py)\n\nExtracts text from various sources (URLs, HTML, Markdown, PDFs, DOCX)\nStandardizes content format for further processing\nPreserves metadata like titles and dates\n\n2. Text Cleaning (text_cleaner.py)\n\nRemoves HTML, formatting codes, and non-prose elements\nNormalizes Unicode characters and whitespace\nFixes sentence boundaries and standardizes punctuation\nEliminates irrelevant content like code blocks and tables\n\n3. Content Optimization (content_optimizer.py)\n\nSegments text into appropriate-sized chunks for fine-tuning\nIdentifies key style markers that represent your writing style\nCreates training examples with proper context and overlap\nFormats examples for various LLM frameworks\n\n4. Dataset Creation (dataset_creator.py)\n\nCreates datasets in multiple formats (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, LLaMA)\nSplits data into training and validation sets\nGenerates comprehensive metadata and style analysis\nPrepares files ready for immediate use in fine-tuning\n\n5. Pipeline Orchestration (fine_tuning_pipeline.py)\n\nCoordinates the entire process end-to-end\nHandles dependency management\nTracks metrics across all stages\nProvides detailed logs and progress tracking\n\n6. Web Interface (web_interface.py)\n\nEasy-to-use browser-based UI for the pipeline\nMonitor progress and view logs in real-time\nConfigure pipeline parameters\nDownload generated datasets in various formats\n\nKey Features\n\nMulti-source support: Process content from websites, files, or entire directories\nParallel processing: Uses multi-threading for faster processing\nStyle analysis: Identifies your unique writing patterns and stylistic elements\nMultiple formats: Generates datasets compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and LLaMA\nQuality control: Extensive cleaning and optimization for better fine-tuning results\nDetailed documentation: Comprehensive README with usage examples\n\nUsage\nYou can use the system through the web interface (recommended) or command line:\nbash# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n\n# Start the web interface\npython web_interface.py\n\n# Or run from command line\npython fine_tuning_pipeline.py --sources [URLs] --val-ratio 0.1\nSystem Requirements\nThe system leverages your powerful hardware setup:\n\nWorks efficiently on your Mac Studio with M2 Ultra and 192GB RAM\nCan process large volumes of content in parallel\nHandles various file formats seamlessly\nDesigned for optimal performance on modern hardware\n\nNext Steps\nAfter running the pipeline:\n\nThe system will create datasets in the blog_finetuning/final directory\nChoose the format that matches your preferred LLM platform (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\nFollow the fine-tuning instructions in the README for your chosen platform\nThe resulting fine-tuned model will write in your distinctive style and tone\n\n\nThe web_interface.py file is a single, self-contained file that creates a Flask-based web interface for managing your fine-tuning pipeline. Here's my assessment:\nCode Structure\nThe file includes:\n\nA complete Flask application\nHTML template content (embedded in the Python file)\nRoute handlers for controlling the pipeline\nBackground thread management for running processes\n\nPotential Issues\nI identified a couple of issues that need to be fixed:\n\nDownload Route Issue: The download_directory function has a problem. It creates a zip file in memory but then tries to use send_from_directory which won't work with the in-memory file. Here's the fix:\n\npython@app.route('/download/<directory>')\ndef download_directory(directory):\n    \"\"\"Download a directory as a ZIP file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        import zipfile\n        from io import BytesIO\n        from flask import send_file\n        \n        final_dir = BASE_DIR / \"final\"\n        dir_path = final_dir / directory\n        \n        if not dir_path.exists() or not dir_path.is_dir():\n            return \"Directory not found\", 404\n        \n        # Create a ZIP file in memory\n        memory_file = BytesIO()\n        \n        with zipfile.ZipFile(memory_file, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:\n            for root, _, files in os.walk(dir_path):\n                for file in files:\n                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)\n                    arcname = os.path.relpath(file_path, final_dir)\n                    zipf.write(file_path, arcname)\n        \n        memory_file.seek(0)\n        \n        return send_file(\n            memory_file,\n            mimetype='application/zip',\n            as_attachment=True,\n            attachment_filename=f\"{directory}_dataset.zip\"\n        )\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error creating download: {e}\")\n        return \"Error creating download\", 500\n\nDeprecated Parameter: The attachment_filename parameter is deprecated in newer Flask versions. This should be updated to:\n\npythonreturn send_file(\n    memory_file,\n    mimetype='application/zip',\n    as_attachment=True,\n    download_name=f\"{directory}_dataset.zip\"\n)\nSingle File vs. Multiple Files\nThe web interface is designed as a single file with the HTML template embedded directly in the Python code. This design choice offers:\n\nAdvantages: Easier distribution as a single file, no need to manage separate template directories\nDisadvantages: Less maintainable for larger applications with multiple pages\n\nFor a more maintainable approach, you could:\n\nMove the HTML template to a separate file in a templates directory\nUse Flask's template rendering system properly\nAdd static assets (CSS, JS) in a separate static directory\n\nIntegration with Other Components\nThe web interface integrates with the other scripts by:\n\nRunning fine_tuning_pipeline.py as a subprocess\nReading pipeline results from the filesystem\nPresenting them in the UI\n\nThis approach works well for a standalone tool but doesn't provide deep integration with the pipeline components.\nConclusion\nThe web_interface.py file is mostly sound but has the issues mentioned above. It's designed as a single, self-contained file that embeds the HTML template.\nFor production use, I recommend:\n\nFixing the download function as suggested\nUpdating the deprecated parameter\nConsidering moving the template to a separate file if you plan to extend the interface\nAdding more robust error handling, especially for larger datasets\n\nWould you like me to provide a fully corrected version of the web interface file?RetryJLyes pleaseEdit[Timestamp: 2025-04-15 13:30:47 UTC]\nHere's the fully corrected version of the web interface file:web_interface.pyCode #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nWeb Interface for LLM Fine-tuning Pipeline\n----------------------------------------\nA simple web interface to manage the fine-tuning preparation process.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport json\nimport subprocess\nimport threadI've provided a corrected version of the web interface file with the following improvements:\n\nFixed the download functionality: I replaced the problematic send_from_directory with send_file to correctly handle the in-memory ZIP file.\nUpdated deprecated parameter: Changed attachment_filename to download_name to work with newer Flask versions.\nEnhanced error handling: Made sure exceptions are properly caught and logged throughout the code.\nImproved code structure: Organized the code for better readability and maintainability.\n\nThe web interface is a single, self-contained file that includes:\n\nA Flask web application\nAn embedded HTML template (created dynamically at runtime)\nRoute handlers for API endpoints\nBackground thread management for running the pipeline\n\nThis design makes it easy to distribute and run without worrying about multiple files. The interface automatically opens a web browser when started and provides:\n\nA user-friendly control panel for configuring and starting the pipeline\nReal-time progress monitoring and logs\nResults summary and visualization\nDataset download capabilities\n\nTo run the web interface, simply execute:\nbashpython web_interface.py\nThis will start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000 and open your default web browser automatically.",
